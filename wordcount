Implement a program to count the frequency of each word in a given text:
python
Copy code
def count_word_frequency(text):
    words = text.lower().split()
    frequency = {}
    for word in words:
        if word in frequency:
            frequency[word] += 1
        else:
            frequency[word] = 1
    return frequency

input_text = input("Enter a text: ")
word_frequency = count_word_frequency(input_text)

print("Word frequency:")
for word, count in word_frequency.items():
    print(word, ":", count)
